                <h3>V Has Come To</h3>
                <p><span>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</span> is a 2015 action-adventure stealth video game
                    developed by
                    Kojima Productions and published by Konami. Directed, written, and designed by Hideo Kojima (as his
                    final work at Konami), it is the ninth installment in the Metal Gear franchise, following Metal Gear
                    Solid V: Ground Zeroes, a stand-alone prologue released the previous year. Set in 1984, nine years
                    after the events of Ground Zeroes, the story follows mercenary leader Punished "Venom" Snake as he
                    ventures into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan and the Angola-Zaire border region to exact revenge on
                    those who destroyed his forces and came close to killing him during the climax of Ground Zeroes.</p>
                <br />

                    The game is played from a third-person perspective in an open world which can be explored either on
                    foot or by modes of transport. Snake can use a wide repertoire of weapons and items and receive
                    assistance from several AI companions, allowing the player to combat enemies either stealthily or
                    directly. Enemy soldiers and resources found in the world can be transported to Snake's
                    headquarters, allowing for its expansion and the development of further technology. The game
                    includes two separate multiplayer modes, Metal Gear Online (also known as Metal Gear Online 3) and
                    Forward Operating Bases (FOBs); the latter mode allows players to develop FOBs, which can then be
                    invaded by other players.</p>
